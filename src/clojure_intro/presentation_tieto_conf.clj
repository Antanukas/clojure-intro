  "John McCarthy was born in Boston, Massachusetts on September 4, 1927 to an Irish immigrant father and a Lithuanian Jewish immigrant mother."

  "Second oldest PL. Older is only Fortran (1957)."

  "Other popular dialects: Common Lisp, Scheme."

  "First realease: 2007, last release 2015 June 30 (2 months ago)"

  "Eric S. Raymond:
    Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it;
    that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot."

  "Motivation: simplicity - building solutions with complext tools on complex infrastructure will make your solution more complex "
