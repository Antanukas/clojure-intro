Agenda

Start with comic opened

Agenda:

I will start with a presentation of Clojure features that can be used to start developing smth working.
At first I gonna give you some history insights folloed by clojure syntax explanation and
examples
Later I hope you will be able to do something yourself. By implementing couple of functions
This will help you familiarize with the tooling at hand and some Clojure code



History:

Clojure is a dialect of lisp. Lisp is really old PL invented in 1957 by John McCarthy.
Interesting thing is that John's mother was Lithuanian :)
Over time Lisp have had many dialects but main principles were left intact.
Clojure is most popular dialect of Lisp so far.

Motivation: simplicity - building solutions with complext tools on complex infrastructure will make your solution more complex.

Functional programming

Clojure is functional language. But what is FL?
There is not concrete definition outhere.
One of definitions could look like this:
FL should have such properties:
    * First class Fns - functions can be passed the same way other types are.
    * Higher order fns - functions that take other functions as parameters
    * Encourage purity - functions without side effects
    * Immutable state - nothing can be mutated. No setters etc.
    * No imperative looping - no for while repeat or similar loops because they will introduce state.
      Remember - everything is immutable.
    * Lazy evaluation

Lisp is feimus for its homoiconicity. In Clojure code is data. You can manipulate Clojure code using Clojure code.
This is done using Macros. Clojure are much more powerful then C macros or even newly introduced Scala macros.
Because of that Clojure itself has very small core everything else is just macros. This way Clojure can be extended endlessly.

All clojure code is written using s-expressions.
Clojure syntax is very simple. Everything is written like (function_or_macro "arg1" "arg2" "..." "argn")
Arithmetic doesn't have any operator precedence because these are just ordinary function calls
Clojure was design to be hosted language. Currently there is 3 implementations.

Remember when I talked about FN. Clojure is functional language but impure.
Well Clojure takes a very practical approach. Functional programming in theaory is a nice thing
however you can't create good things without state. So clojure provides threadsafe primitives
for state mutation. So thats why it is called impure.

Clojure is dynamic and strongly types. You can't add 1 integer to string "1"


Here are clojure features I will try to cover today.
We will meet REPL used for interactive development. No more build deploy cycles.
Talk about data types in clojure
Namespaces are used for grouping fns (java packages)
We will see first class functions in action as well as immutability.
You will use lazy sequences without even knowing that.
How to handle errors?

Today we will not talk about advanced topics like concurrent programming,
runtime polymorphism - an alternative in clojure to smth like OOP polymorphism
macros and you also won't see much Java interop.

So as I said namespaces here are for grouping our functions.
E.g in this namespace I have defined all presentation related stuff.
For this workshop imagine that namespaces are packages.

Clojure data types. Clojure has really similar datatypes as Java.
We have numbers - integers, doubles, bigdecimals.
One unique clojure type for numbers is Ratio.
Strings are really a java String (class String). Also all operations that work with sequences work with strings.
Characters are also java characters
Booleans. Just Clojure treats truth differently then Java. We will see that later.
Keywords are special to Clojure. For now lets assume they are great keys for maps
Symbols are special type too. funciton names, variables names are all symbols.
List is an immutable linked list
Vector immutable array list.
Set - immutable set
map - immutable map.
